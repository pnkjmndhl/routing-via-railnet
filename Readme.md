# RAILNET

RAILNET is a program that implements a tested algorithm that predicts traffic patterns in a given network.
It requires several attributes which are generated by each folder in this repository.

### 1. Commodity:
For flows, its uses rail carload waybill sample collected by the Surface Transportation Board.
The Origin Railroad (ORR), Origin FIPS Code, Commodity and Gross Tons from the waybill sample 
are used to calculate empty rails.
After getting a successful base flows, scenario flows are injected to RAILNET to obtain scenario flows. 

### 2. Cost:
Cost attributes by Railroad and commodity (including emptys) are implemented in the program.
Cost attributes include 
*TrainCost/hr*,
*Cost/gross-ton-mile*,
*terminal-processing-cost/car,fixed*,
*terminal-cost/car-hr*,
*transfer-cost/car*,
*car-payload*,
*car-tare-wt*,
*Gross-Car-Weight*,
*Cars-per-Train*, and
*Gross-Train-Weight*.

### 3. Network:
The actual GIS map of US-Railroads with attributes are converted RAILNET readable 
network.dat here. If any links or nodes are added, Node IDs and Link IDs are generated
based on the FIPS they are in. If the network has missing attributes, they are
autogenerated and flagged.

### 4. Transfers:
Excel version of transfers is plotted, nearest nodes with specified railroads are found, manual
transfers are added and plotted. These plotted points are then converted to transfer.exc here.

### 5. Exceptions:
Link Exception and Transfer Exception are converted to *link.exc* and *transfer.exc* here.

### 6. Netdata:
The actual program resides here. 

### 7. Output:
The output (.out) from RAILNET is changed to (.csv) here. Right now, the program 
extracts Gross Tons by Railroad, Delay Time and Actual Travel Time.



#### Things to consider:
1. Update the cost attributes before running commodity.py
2. Update the transfers anytime you change the railroads sufficiently enough to change
the snappings of excel transfers.
